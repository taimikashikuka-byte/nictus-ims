Efficient inventory management is essential for the success of furniture retailers, where products are high in value, take up considerable space, and come in a wide range of styles and configurations. Dependence on manual inventory tracking often leads to inefficiencies, errors, and difficulties in maintaining optimal stock levels (Andewar et al., 2019). Modern inventory management systems (IMS), especially those employing technologies like RFID and barcode scanning, enable real-time tracking, automation, and data-driven decision-making, which are crucial for a furniture store in Windhoek to remain competitive and satisfy customer needs (CPCon Group, 2025; Unleashed Software, 2023).
